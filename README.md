## Passion Project - Women's Ice Hockey

As we’ve seen in the news over the last few years, female athletes are fighting for better pay and better resources for their sports. Both the U.S. women’s soccer national team and U.S. women’s ice hockey national team have gone on strike during big tournaments to push for better salaries and more resources. In 2017, the U.S. women’s ice hockey national team did not play in the World Championships demanding higher pay, more games in non-Olympic years, and more money spent on developing girl’s youth hockey programs.

Big Goal: I plan to compare women's ice hockey player’s stats and accomplishments to their salaries as well as examine trends in salaries. I would also like to examine the areas that these players come from to determine which areas are best supporting women’s hockey development.

Result: A web application with typical information about top statistics, graphics on salary trends, and graphics of areas producing the most players.
